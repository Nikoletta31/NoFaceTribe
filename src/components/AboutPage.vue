      <span class="link cursor-pointer font-bold">No Face Tribe (NFT)</span> is
      a project that has been created at the beginning of 2022 and launched on
      the symbolic date of
      <span class="link cursor-pointer font-bold">22.02.2022</span>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      To follow the good wish of the number, we have followed the same way by
      creating 1111 unique NFT images.

      The idea of No Face Tribe project came to us with everything that was
      happening to our world during the last two years. We had to wear masks and
      hide our faces. It was not the best period for humanity but it is
      something that none will forget.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The heroes of No Face Tribe are wearing masks but those masks are very
      unusual. They are different, fun, and remarkable. The tribe, the face of
      who we can never see is the tribe of those who would want to stay
      anonymous but at the same time, they want to stay unique by wearing
      different looks and creating their style.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Do you think we would have to wear the masks again? Well, if so, what if
      those masks were a little bit different?
